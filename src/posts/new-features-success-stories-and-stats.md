We are thrilled to announce two exciting new features on the Pixar Educational Consultancy website, designed to provide you with greater transparency and a clearer picture of our commitment to student success.

## 1. A Dedicated Page for Our Success Stories

Building trust is at the heart of what we do, and what better way to show our dedication than by celebrating the achievements of our students? We have launched a brand new **[Success Stories page](/success-stories)**!

This page features a comprehensive, country-by-country list of students who have successfully obtained their visas with our guidance. You can now easily see the breadth of our experience across top destinations like the USA, Australia, Canada, the UK, and New Zealand.

We believe that seeing real results from real students provides peace of mind and confidence as you begin your own study abroad journey.

## 2. Why Choose Pixar Edu? See Our Impact at a Glance!

We've revamped our homepage to better answer the question: "Why Choose Pixar Edu?" Instead of just telling you, we're now showing you our impact with a new **dynamic and animated achievements section**.

When you scroll down the [homepage](/), you'll see key metrics come to life with counters that animate as they enter the screen. This section highlights our:

*   **Visas Approved**
*   **Students Enrolled Abroad**
*   **University & College Partnerships**
*   **Years of Experience**
...and more!

This feature gives you a quick, engaging overview of our extensive experience and the sheer volume of students we've proudly assisted over the years. It's a testament to the hard work of our team and the trust that students and parents place in us.

## We're Always Improving for You

These new features are part of our ongoing effort to make our website a more helpful and transparent resource for aspiring international students from Nepal. We invite you to explore the new sections and see for yourself why Pixar Educational Consultancy is the right partner for your global education dreams.
