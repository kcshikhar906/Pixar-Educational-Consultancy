The U.S. State Department has **resumed processing student visas** after a temporary suspension, but introduced a **new requirement**: all applicants must set their social media accounts to **public** for government review.

## 📱 **Enhanced Social Media Screening**

Consular officers will now review applicants' online activity for posts or messages that could be perceived as **hostile to the U.S.**, its values, culture, institutions, or founding principles. Applicants who **refuse** to comply may face visa **rejection**.

This move by the **Trump administration**, originally announced in May, briefly halted visa interviews while expanding social media vetting.

## 🎒 **Student Reactions: Relief and Concern**

Students from countries like **China, India, Mexico, and the Philippines** have expressed both **relief** that interviews are resuming and **anxiety** about the new requirements. A 27‑year‑old PhD student in Toronto said,  
> “I’m really relieved … I’ve been refreshing the website a couple of times every day.”

## 🔍 **Broader Visa Scrutiny Underway**

The policy is part of a larger pattern of intensified **vetting for international students**, including:
- Earlier revocation of thousands of student visas due to minor offenses  
- A temporary block on students attending institutions like Harvard  
- A mandate for **36 countries** to improve vetting or face travel bans

## ⚖️ **Privacy and Free Speech Concerns**

Civil liberties groups warn the policy risks chilling **legitimate political expression**. Jameel Jaffer of Columbia University’s Knight First Amendment Institute compared it to **Cold War–era ideological screening**.

## ✅ **What This Means for Prospective Students**

| Key Requirement | Details |
|-----------------|---------|
| **Social Media** | Must be public and fully accessible |
| **Visa Interviews** | Now active—schedule ASAP |
| **Vetting** | Expect more scrutiny of online activity |
| **Risks** | Possible denial if accounts are private or offensive |
