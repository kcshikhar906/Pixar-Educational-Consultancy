## 📝 Study Permit Basics: What You Need to Know

To study in Canada, you generally need a study permit. Here are the key requirements:

*   **Acceptance Letter (LOA)**: You must have an official Letter of Acceptance from a **Designated Learning Institution (DLI)** in Canada. Ensure your chosen institution is on the DLI list.
*   **Proof of Financial Support**: You need to demonstrate that you can financially support yourself during your studies. This includes funds for:
    *   Tuition fees
    *   Living expenses (currently, for a single applicant outside Quebec, this is CAD $10,000 per year, in addition to tuition. This figure can change, so always check the official IRCC website).
    *   Return transportation for yourself.
*   **No Criminal Record**: You may need to provide a police certificate.
*   **Good Health**: You might need to undergo a medical examination.
*   **Intent to Leave Canada**: You must satisfy the visa officer that you will leave Canada at the end of your authorized stay. Strong ties to your home country (e.g., family, property, job prospects) are important to demonstrate.

An example of financial planning: If your tuition is `CAD $18,000` and living expenses are estimated at `CAD $12,000`, you'd need to show access to at least `CAD $30,000` for the first year.

### Application Process Overview:

1.  Apply to and get accepted by a DLI.
2.  Gather all necessary documents (LOA, financial proofs, identity documents, etc.).
3.  Apply for your study permit online or through a Visa Application Centre (VAC).
4.  You might be asked to provide biometrics (fingerprints and a photo).
5.  Attend an interview if requested.
